// An Array is a Data Structure which describes how we can hold data together.

/*Suppose we wanted to model a group of friends:
let friend1 = "Tim";
let friend2 = "John";
let friend3 = "Sally";
let friend4 = "Rebecca";

THIS IS NOT DRY

use an array:

let friends = ['Tim', 'John', 'Sally', 'Rebecca'];

friends[0] = Tim
friends[1] = John
friends[2] = Sally
friends[3] = Rebecca

Always start from 0 index.


*/

let friends = ["Tim", "john"];
console.log(friends);
friends[0] = "Jake";
console.log(friends);


let arrays = [4, "Helloo", true, null, 4.4];
console.log(arrays);
console.log(arrays.length);
